CB,Food Balances: Commodity Balances (non-food) (2010-),"Most crop and livestock products, including processed products, under agricultural activity.","Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.",Mr. Salar Tayyib,faostat@fao.org,2022-08-25T00:00:00,zip,csv,859KB,117560,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/CommodityBalances_(non-food)_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip

It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart.  When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture value added, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates database (UNSD AMA).  In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator, the implicit value added deflator of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery and the implicit value added deflator of Manufacturing are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2015 prices (base year).",Veronica Boero,macrostats@fao.org,2023-08-16T00:00:00,zip,csv,905KB,83524,https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Deflators_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
