CBH,"Food Balances: Commodity Balances (non-food) (-2013, old methodology)","Most crop and livestock products, including processed products, under agricultural activity.","Food Balance Sheet presents a comprehensive picture of the pattern of a country's food supply during a specified reference period. The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.",Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS),faostat@fao.org,2021-12-03T00:00:00,zip,csv,7700KB,1184986,https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/CommodityBalances_(non-food)_(-2013_old_methodology)_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
CS,Macro-Economic Indicators: Capital Stock,"Agriculture, forestry and fishing (ISIC A+B Rev.3 and A Rev.4)","As part of the FAO Agriculture Capital Stock (ACS) database, ESS-FAO publishes country-by-country data on physical investment in agriculture, forestry and fishing as measured by the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Additional variables included in the ACS are Net and Gross Capital Stock, Consumption of Fixed Capital, the Agriculture Investment ratio, and the Gross Fixed Capital Formation Agriculture Orientation Index. The FAO Agriculture Capital Stock Database is an analytical database: whenever available, the database integrates official National Accounts data harvested from the UNSD National Accounts Main Aggregates Database (UNSD AMA) and the OECD Annual National Accounts Database (OECD ANA). The database is further supplemented by OECD Structural Analysis database (OECD STAN) and in a few countries data from the countryâs statistics website. If the full set of official data is not available for any specific country, imputation methods are applied to obtain estimates over the complete time series. Many data points in ACS are estimated and are flagged as such; they do not represent official Member countries' submissions. With a view of producing internationally comparable net capital stock estimates, we employ the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) with a time invariant geometric depreciation rate to impute missing data. The Perpetual Inventory Method is a well-established economic model to calculate Net Capital Stocks (NCS) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC) from time series of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF). Specifically, annual measures of the NCS are obtained from cumulating historical series on physical investment flows and deducting the part of assets that are depreciated (the Consumption of Fixed Capital that occurs in every period). In order to implement the PIM, long time series on aggregate GFCF in agriculture, forestry and fishing is required. As much as possible, we rely on National Accounts data published by the OECD and UNSD. When country data are partially or fully missing, we employ econometric techniques to impute missing observations. Depending on the pattern of data missingness for the countries, different imputation methods are applied (selected from the ARMAX, PANEL and OLS classes of econometric models) for the data series from 1995 to 2021.The values of Agriculture Capital Stock related indicators for 2022, including Agriculture Investment Ratio, Agriculture Orientation Index, Net Capital Stock, Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Consumption of Fixed Capital, are estimated using the Holt-Winters (HW) method (Cipra et al., 1995). The HW method is an exponential smoothing method for forecasting the annual values of economic variables. In this context, the HW method relies on existing (historical) values of the Agriculture Capital Stock. The predicted value is an extrapolation of the historical values to the specified target date, which extends the timeline without considering seasonality in the annual series.All data series in the database are provided both in national currencies and in US dollars as well as in current prices and constant prices with base year 2015. Calculation of constant price series is done applying GFCF deflator series. When OECD National Accounts data are available, an OECD implicit deflator for agriculture GFCF is calculated and used. For other cases, the implicit deflators on GFCF for total economy available from the FAOSTAT Deflators database is used.","Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).: Statistics Division (ESS), Economic Statistics Team.",macrostats@fao.org,2023-12-22T00:00:00,zip,csv,1329KB,139394,https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Investment_CapitalStock_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip

It is obtained by dividing a current price value of a given aggregate by its real counterpart.  When calculated from the major national accounting aggregates such as GDP or agriculture value added, implicit price deflators pertains to wider ranges of goods and services in the economy than that represented by any of the individual price indexes (such as CPIs, PPIs). Movements in an implicit price deflator reflect both changes in price and changes in the composition of the aggregate for which the deflator is calculated.In the FAOSTAT Deflators database, all series are derived from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Analysis of Main Aggregates database (UNSD AMA).  In particular, the implicit GDP deflator, the implicit GFCF deflator, the implicit value added deflator of Agriculture, Forestry, Fishery and the implicit value added deflator of Manufacturing are obtained by dividing the series in current prices by those in constant 2015 prices (base year).","Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO): Statistics Division (ESS), Economic and Social Statistics Team",macrostats@fao.org,2024-06-12T00:00:00,zip,csv,1003KB,85057,https://bulks-faostat.fao.org/production/Deflators_E_All_Data_(Normalized).zip
