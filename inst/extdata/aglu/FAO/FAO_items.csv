# Title: Mapping of FAO items from different FAOSTAT dataset source
# Units: NA
# Description: This mapping is constructed to generate balanced data based best sources
# The corresponding CPC and FBS item and code are included when available
# Items are separated into different tiers based on data source
# Item_code should be unique. For non-FAO items including some cakes and meat Eq their code were created by adding 0000 to the corresponding oil or animal items
# Tier1 includes 169 items with best sources e.g. bilateral trade (TM)  prodstat (QCL) and supply-utilization-account (SCL)
#  Note that item 237 Oil soybean was moved from Tier1 to Tier2 to use SCL for production due to Brazil data issue in QCL
#  SCL has balanced data processed by FAO but the quality was poor with low consistency
# Tier2 includes 139 items that had no data or low quality data in QCL so used production from SCL
# Tier3 includes 60 items that had QCL but no bilateral trade data so use gross trade from SCL
# Tier4 includes 84 items included in SCL but not in Tier1-3
# Tier5 includes 10 oilseed cake items that were omitted in FAOSTAT
#  Note  key oilseed cake data are not currently provided by FAOSTAT after 2013. We extrapolate the data based on oil-cake rates in 2010 to 2013
# Tier6 includes 29 items that included in QCL for production but not in Tier1 to Tier5
# Tier7 includes 12 fish items from FBS and FBSH. Item code came from FBS as well
# Tier8 include 11 cake or fiber items that coproduced in oil crop crushing. Item code used 0
#  Note the FAOSTAT does not provide data for Tier8 item so they are generated based extraction rate and assumed no trade and single use.
# Tier9 includes 16 meat equivalent items converted from live animals. Item code used 0
#  Note that these items were preprocessed based on mainly carcass yield implied by data for adjusting production and stocks
#  Note that for meat equivalent items only stock variation was accounted since 2010 when the data first available
#  Note that item_code (982 953 311) are moved to Tier3 from Tier1 since TM data not available after 2010.
