# File: Mapping_FBSH_SCL_OilCake.csv
# Title: Mapping of FAO oilseed oil and cake items from different FAOSTAT dataset source
# Units: NA
# Description: This mapping is used to extrapolate oilseed cake rate based on available historical data
# Note that FAO did not update nonfood use data (CB) after 2013 so we need to estimate oilseed cake based on rates
# FBSH_item_cake from CB. FBSH_item_oil from FBSH. SCL has oil item but not cake items. Rape and Mustard Cake duplicated in mapping since new data separated the two.
# Last update: 8-10-2022 (XZ)
