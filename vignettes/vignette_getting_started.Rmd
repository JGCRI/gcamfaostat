## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a>  

Global economic and multisector dynamic models have become pivotal tools for investigating complex interactions between human activities and the environment, as evident in recent research [@Doelman2022Quantifying;@Fujimori2022Land-based;@IPCC2022Annex;@Ven2023multimodel]. Agriculture and land use (AgLU) plays a critical role in these models, particularly when used to address key agroeconomics questions [@Graham2023Agricultural;@Yarlagadda2023Trade;@Zhang2023Agriculture;@Zhao2021Global;@Zhao2020critical]. Sound economic modeling hinges significantly upon the accessibility and quality of data [@Bruckner2019FABIO;@Calvin2022GMD;@Chepeliev2022JGEA]. The Food and Agriculture Organization Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) [@FAOSTAT2023FAOSTAT] serves as the most important data source, offering open-access data on country-level agricultural production, land use, trade, food consumption, nutrient content, prices, and more. However, the raw data from FAOSTAT requires cleaning, balancing, and synthesis, involving assumptions such as interpolation and mapping, which can introduce uncertainties. It is noteworthy that each agroeconomic modeling team typically develops its own assumptions and methods to prepare and process FAOSTAT data [@bond2019gcamdata]. While largely overlooked, the uncertainty in the base calibration data likely contributed to the disparities in model outcomes [@Lampe2014AgMIP;@zhao2021role]. Hence, our motivation is to create an open-source tool (`gcamfaostat`) for the preparation, processing, and synthesis of FAOSTAT data for global agroeconomic modeling.  The tool can also be valuable to a broader range of users interested in understanding global agriculture trends and dynamics, as it provides accessible and processed data and [visualization](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamfaostat/articles/vignette_visualization.html) functions.

## The gap `gcamfaostat` fills <a name="Gap"></a> 

gcamfaostat, gcamdata, GCAM, and the broader modeling community  

`gcamdata` [@bond_lamberty_2023] 

Figure 1  shows the relationship between `gcamfaostat` and `gcamdata` with example modules of each packages presented.

Modules with identifier `_xfaostat_` only exists in `gcamfaostat`. Agriculture and land use (AgLU) related modules (`_aglu_`) that rely on outputs from `gcamfaostat` can run in both packages. Other `gcamdata` modules processing data in areas such as energy, emissions, water, and socioeconomics only exist in `gcamdata`.

## Installing `gcamfaostat` <a name="Install"></a>  

####  R

* R version 4.0 or higher and RStudio are recommonded. 

#### Clone this repository

* On the command line: navigate to your desired folder location and then enter `git clone https://github.com/JGCRI/gcamfaostat.git` 

* If using GitHub Desktop: Go to https://github.com/jgcri/gcamfaostat and click the green "Code" button. Then click "Open with GitHub Desktop".

#### Loading the `gcamfaostat` package

* Open the `gcamfaostat` folder you just cloned and double-click the `gcamfaostat.Rproj` file. RStudio should open the project.

* If you have not installed `devtools` before, first enter the following into the R console  
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

* Then to load the `gcamfaostat` package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
```

#### Package dependencies
* You may also need to install package dependencies, for example using:
```R
devtools::install_deps()
```
* Note that could be issues with some recent package dependencies. Users can consider using `renv`. 

  * `renv` is an R package for dependency management. 
  * Using it will save a private R library with the correct versions of any package dependencies. 
  * Please find more details [here](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamdata/articles/getting-started/getting-started.html#optional-renv-currently-included-in-gcam-6-0-and-gcamdata-release) in `gcamdata` manual.



## Run the driver <a name="driver"></a>  
#### `driver_drake` and `driver`
Users should now be ready to run the driver, which is the main processing function that generates intermediate data outputs and final output (csv or other files) for `GCAM` (`gcamdata`) or other models. Driver functions will run data processing modules/functions sequentially, see [Processing Flow](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamfaostat/articles/vignette_processing_flow.html). There are two ways to run the driver, both inherited  from `gcamdata`.

1. `driver_drake()`

`driver_drake()` runs the driver and stores the outputs in a hidden cache. When you run `driver_drake()` again it will skip steps that are up-to-date. This is useful if you will be adjusting the data inputs and code and running the data system multiple times. For this reason, we almost always recommend using `driver_drake()`. More details can be found in the [here](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamdata/articles/driverdrake_vignette.html).

2. `driver()`  

See [here](https://jgcri.github.io/gcamdata/reference/driver.html) for more options when running the driver, such as what outputs to generate or when to stop.

For `gcamfaostat`, it is recommended to use `driver_drake()` so the data tracing and exploring after the drive will be possible, even thought it may take longer to run and additional space (for drake cache) compared to `driver()`. 

#### Output files  
* In `constants.R`, users can set `OUTPUT_Export_CSV == TRUE` and specify the output directory (`DIR_OUTPUT_CSV`) to export and store the output csv files. 
* The default directory is `outputs/gcamfaostat_csv_output`.
* Users can also make use of the functions to trace the processing by step, when`driver_drake()` is employed.
