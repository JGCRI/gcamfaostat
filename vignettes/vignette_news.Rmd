# FAOSTAT Commodity Balance (CB) updates
2023-09-25 
* Good news: It seems FAOSTAT just made the updated Commodity Balance (CB) dataset available. Previously, it only includes data up to 2013, i.e., consistent with FBSH. It is now adding a new dataset that include data from 2010-2020, consistent with FBH.
* However: 
  + The `update history` on FAOSTAT might not be the history of data availability. It says last update was 2022-12-23. But per 2023-08-20 archive, the data was still not available.
  + Bulk download seems not enabled yet.
  + Dataset code will likely change. CB seems reserved for the new data and the old one might be CBH. 
* Stay tuned.

# Goals for the next version include:
2023-09-25  

* Improve the documentation and the visualization of the *module_aglu_L100.FAO_SUA_PrimaryEquivalent* module
  + The module developed a new method of primary commodity equivalent aggregation to aggregate supply-utilization-accounting (SUA) data for items along the supply chain (e.g., wheat flour, bran, and germ to wheat-primary-equivalent). 
  + The method preserves balance across space (trade balance), time (storage carryover), supply-utilization, and the combination of these dimensions with minimal adjustments. 
  + We have applies the new method of primary equivalent aggregation to aggregating FAO ~500 SUA (SCL) items to ~100 primary equivalent items in FAO Food Balance Sheet (FBS).
* Compare the results from the new primary commodity equivalent method with the FBS data compiled using FAOSTAT method (never disclosed).
